    "## Exercise 1: Implementing `DummyClassifier` \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "rubric={points:25}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course (unlike CPSC 340) you will generally **not** be asked to implement machine learning algorihtms (like logistic regression) from scratch. However, this exercise is an exception: you will implement the simplest possible classifier, `DummyClassifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, `DummyClassifier` is meant as a baseline and is generally the worst possible \"model\" you could \"fit\" to a dataset. All it does is predict the most popular class in the training set. So if there are more 0s than 1s it predicts 0 every time, and if there are more 1s than 0s it predicts 1 every time. For `predict_proba` it looks at the frequencies in the training set, so if you have 30% 0's 70% 1's it predicts `[0.3 0.7]` every time. Thus, `fit` only looks at `y` (not `X`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find starter code for a class called `MyDummyClassifier`, which has methods `fit()`, `predict()`, `predict_proba()` and `score()`. Your task is to fill in those four functions. To get your started, I have given you a `return` statement in each case that returns the correct data type: `fit` can return nothing, `predict` returns an array whose size is the number of examples, `predict_proba` returns an array whose size is the number of examples x 2, and `score` returns a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next code block has some tests you can use to assess whether your code is working. \n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest starting with `fit` and `predict`, and making sure those are working before moving on to `predict_proba`. For `predict_proba`, you should return the frequency of each class in the training data, which is the behaviour of `DummyClassifier(strategy='prior')`. Your `score` function should call your `predict` function. Again, you can compare with `DummyClassifier` using the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify this question, you can assume **binary classification**, and furthermore that these classes are **encoded as 0 and 1**. In other words, you can assume that `y` contains only 0s and 1s. The real `DummyClassifier` works when you have more than two classes, and also works if the target values are encoded differently, for example as \"cat\", \"dog\", \"mouse\", etc."

    "A `max_features` value of 1000 seems to work best. This is because the  plot of accuracy vs max_features shows that the training and validation accuracies begin to diverge around the point when `max_features = 1000`. This means that near this point, increasing the value of `max_features` will not increase the validation accuracy as much anymore but the training accuracy will continue to increase which indicates a potential overfitting scenario as the gap between validation and training accuracy is becoming increasingly large. One must be careful at this point since the learning performed by the model might be too specific to the training set (e.g. based on very high training accuracy) and may not generalize well enough to unseen data (e.g. the validation/test sets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the highest validation accuracy is achieved when `max_features = 100000`, it is only marginally higher but its training accuracy is suspiciously high. It may not be wise to select this model since a really high training accuracy may indicate that the model may not generalize well on completely unseen data. Thus, in this case, we are selecting the set of hyperparameters that fits a \"simpler\" model, despite producing a marginally lower CV score."

    "Based on the plot, the `C` value of 0.100000 seems to perform best. Although other `C` values like 0.316228, 1.0, or 3.162278, produce higher validation accuracies, they are only marginally higher. However, their corresponding training accuracies are considerably higher which may suggest an overfitting scenario. Thus, it may be appropriate to choose a \"simpler\" model that has lower training accuracy but similar validation accuracy. This is produced when `C = 0.1`. The reasoning for not choosing the hyperparameter with highest cross-validation accuracy is the same as that of part (b)."

    "1. The problem with calling `fit_transform` on the test data with `CountVectorizer` is that the `fit` portion of `fit_transform` will learn a vocabulary dictionary from the input dataset and thus, this \"fitting\" process is only meant to be performed on the training dataset. If we apply it to the test dataset, we are violating the Golden Rule of ML as our test data will be influencing the training process.\n",
    "2. It is critical to follow the Golden Rule of ML b/c it ensures that the test/validation datasets NEVER influence the training phase in any way. If the rule is violated, this would likely give a better classifier (assuming evaluation is done on the validation/test sets) because the model would've already seen parts of the validation/test data during the training phase - this is a problem as this provides misleading training results which will likely produce a model that does not generalize well.\n",
    "3. It would be wise to choose `predict_proba()` since that returns the confidence score or probability score for each input example. With this data, we can simply select the target class label with the highest probability score as the output prediction (which would be the output of `predict()`).\n",
    "4. One advantage of using a sklearn `Pipeline` is the ability to apply multiple sequential steps of training together (while enforcing the order of steps) which may include data pre-processing (e.g. imputation, scaling, encoding), followed by fitting the transformed data. Another advantage is that pipelines are much easier to read and re-use for different purposes such as grid-searching or cross-validation.\n",
    "5. `RandomizedSearchCV` is faster compared to `GridSearchCV` and it also works better when there are parameters that are more important than others (i.e. varying unimportant hyperparameter will not impact the performance of the model score)."
